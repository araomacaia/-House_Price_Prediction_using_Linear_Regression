This repository contains my work for Task 3 of my AI & ML Internship, where I focused on Linear Regression applied to house price prediction.
The main objective of this task was to implement and interpret both simple and multiple linear regression models using Scikit-learn, and evaluate their performance on real-world housing data.

The project demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing to model interpretation, with emphasis on understanding regression coefficients and validation metrics.
